#### Content of this repository
- This code is Fulfillment for [DialogFlow](https://dialogflow.com/) (ex [api.ai](https://www.api.ai))
- Use
[Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions) as "backend service"
- Use
[Kotlin](https://www.kotlinlang.org/) as language for Cloud Functions (compile in JavaScript)


### Project Setup

1. `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. `git clone https://github.com/jacklt/Assistant-for-events.git`
3. Create a Firebase Project using the Firebase Developer Console
4. Initialize Firebase
   ```
   cd Assistant-for-events
   firebase init
   ```
5. Install the dependencies and deploy
   ```
   cd functions
   npm install
   firebase deploy
   ```
   
#### Note about Kotlin
Note: with Kotlin you need to build the JavaScript files before
deploying, so there's an npm script that does the steps.  You can see
that and a few other handy shortcuts in [package.json](functions/package.json)
